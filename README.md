# EM328 Web App
> This is the repo for my code written for weekly individual projects during my EM328 course.

## Description
Simple web app that shows my ability to create a login script using PHP sessions. Once logged in, the proof moves into my ability to use JavaScript to validate form data, as well as highly responsive web design.
